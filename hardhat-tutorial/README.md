This project is one of the lessons from LearnWeb3DAO.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
Whitelist Contract Address: 0x774337FC091C2C3dab6fAE0D2ca61155A5d6E0A5
